/**
 * Some hacked together code which opens the framebuffer device on a
 * PocketCHIP and draws a short line. Woo.
 *
 * The code works but may be a bit rubbish-y as it's been many years since
 * I've done this sort of thing. The code requires (and checks) that the
 * framebuffer is 32 bits per pixel as that lets me cheat and make many
 * assumptions. This is true when I wrote this code, but who knows what
 * future updates for the PocketCHIP will do?
